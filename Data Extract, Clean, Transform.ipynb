      " \"AREX is a highly ambitious financial technology start-up in the alternative financial services space that aims to change the way small and mid-sized companies access short-term financing.In Europe alone small and mid-sized companies' lack of access to affordable short-term financing is a € 250 billion annual challenge that causes slowdown in the economy, unemployment and lost growth and investment opportunities. All attempts so far have been too complex or expensive in the trade receivables area to truly scale beyond niche providers. Due to breakthroughs in modern technology, machine learning &amp; quantitative finance we've been able to develop a solution that converts these heterogeneous trade receivables into a highly liquid, standardized, non-correlated asset class that can be traded with extremely low overhead on the AREX exchange.We're committed in driving a € 25 billion annual decrease in the current financing gap by the year 2020 and our vision is to ultimately abolish that financing gap completely. AREX will empower SMEs to access affordable short–term financing and fuel their growth while providing great investment opportunities to investors in the form of this newly minted asset class. We believe that AREX can catalyze this revolution and drive an order of magnitude change in the pricing of this current finance industry backwater.\"\n",

With so many ideas and only so much bandwidth to execute, open communication is key. We\\'re small, lean, and nimble so your opinion is expected and respected. But, when you present an idea, be ready to defend it - because we question everything. It\\'s this type of collaboration that helps us decide what to focus our energies on next.Strive for PerfectionWe fail every day, and it\\'s awesome, because it means we\\'re getting closer. There\\'s a push to get our features out there and it\\'s often a sacrifice to hit those deadlines, but given the sensitive nature of what GoRefi does, putting features out just for the sake of putting features out doesn\\'t fly. We prefer to take a bit of extra time to do it right, even though we\\'re moving at light speed compared to our competitors.Don\\'t be a \"Larry\"No offense if your name is Larry, of course. In this example, Larry\\'s the typical used-car salesman selling you rust protection when you live in California or the fly-by-night mortgage broker charging you exorbitant fees and putting you in the wrong loan. This lie-cheat-steal crap is all over the web and in case you couldn\\'t tell already - we\\'re sick of it. A Larry is enticed by quotas - not service - and is compensated without justification of hours worked or exceptional performance. They sell for themselves and for their wallet, with a short-term vision that hurts everyone in their lives, especially their customers. At GoRefi, we don\\'t have a Sales Department - we only have Support. Our clients get what\\'s best for them and only them. Our motive is and always will be to ensure that our clients are happy with their experience.'\n",

In fact, at Goldstar we like to say that we’re not in the business of finding buyers for our tickets, we’re in the business of finding tickets for our buyers.'\n",

      " \"History &amp; Background The Bank started its activities in Feb. 1985 at the time when the economic arena was characterized by major developments, a matter which gave the bank mission special significance, as Egypt was suffering at that time from great pressures on its balance of payments. This was apart from the rising deficit of the balance of trade. Consequently, the external debt problem started to represent a sort of concern to the Egyptian economy in all its sectors.The Bank was founded as a financial institution to boost Egyptian exports. The export development issue is not only an economic policy to cope with the balance of payments problem, but also represents a strategic trend for development policies in a global economy that gets closer and integrated every day. Accordingly, the export sector is a crucial propeller for modernization and development. There are various examples of many small and medium size countries in which the export sector played a significant role in developing their economies.General Trend of Bank Activities Export Development Bank of Egypt adopts special measures such as excellence and quality in playing its pivotal role. Through its distinguished performance, the bank aims to be one of the remarkable financial centers, thus it does not confine its target to attain maximum profitability only, but also to achieve prosperity.Since its inception, the Bank has managed to maintain its identity as a commercial and investment bank; rather than a deposit collecting retail commercial bank. The bank has always been eager to support the export sector through financing investment projects pertaining to such sector, which is contrary to the main philosophy of commercial banks that aim at working capital financing for existing projects. In Egypt common practice has shown that most of the development banks have turned to current operations and deposit gathering, acting as mere commercial banks and thus deviating from their authentic target of being investment and development financial institutions.The bank resorted to opening of new branches and gathering deposits in order to meet its main goal of establishing and boosting a solid export sector. Consequently, the bank persisted on gathering deposits of companies and corporations in order to be a wholesale bank. The bank re-affirmed its geographic presence in export oriented locations like that of Alexandria that was opened in May 1989 and Tenth of Ramadan in September 1989.With the change of the government monetary policy during the early nineties, and the tendency to develop sources of finance through issuing treasury bills and bonds, and lifting subsidized interest rates by all means,\\xa0 the bank was motivated to establish a network of branches to mobilize financial resources. Accordingly, the network of branches at our bank had increasingly expanded to 21 branches in March 2012.With the beginning of the financial reform in 2004 following the amendment of Central Bank Law, as well as The Banking Sector and Money Law no. 88/2003, Central Bank reclassified all banks thus giving them full freedom to open new branches and promote several saving. Accordingly, the bank had to rectify all its future plans to include branch expansion policy, as well as the new banking products that concern individuals and corporations.\\xa0\\xa0Developments of Bank's Activities :Throughout the life of the Bank that exceeds quarter of a century, EDBE witnessed numerous aspect of development, most significant of which were the following:Ownership :Ownership:Regarding ownership structure, the Bank has endeavored to develop the Egyptian capital market through launching new products in order to assume its basic role as an important source of funding. At first, the bank managed to change its articles of association to allow the private sector and the Egyptian family sector to contribute to its capital. It also aspired to allow its staff to own some shares of its capital part as one kind of propagating the culture of dealing with the capital market and as an incentive to the staff to further foster their loyalty and belonging to the institution in which they work.On the other hand, the Bank managed to establish companies focusing on export development, thus allowing the staff own some shares of their capital. Such companies realized good gains for the bank when sold e.g. Roto Pack and Techno Pack.Loans &amp; advancesIt is worth mentioning that the Bank's loans and advances portfolio has experienced several phases of progress throughout the history of the Bank. At the beginning, the bank focused on medium term finance for export projects or those that aim at exports in order to increase the export capacity of the country thus propagating the culture of production for export and not export of surplus products.In a subsequent phase, the bank expanded to focus on financing the working capital of different sectors of the economy.The global financial crisis at the end of the twentieth century that hit the banking sector in Egypt left behind it several criticized and troubled debts that had, in turn, its effects on our Bank. Subsequently, our Bank encountered some difficulties as a result of having a high segment of exporters who deal with the external world, thus encountering some problems which, in turn, had its effects on the credit portfolio. Nevertheless, through its efforts and due to its high coverage ratio and credit worthiness, the bank became one of the most reputable high ranking institutions regarding the quality of its loan portfolio.\\xa0\"\n",

      " \"Newspaper Club is a service to help anyone make and print their own newspapers. Our mission is to give people the tools to turn whatever they want into newsprint, quickly and easily.The company was founded in 2009 by Ben\\xa0Terrett, Tom\\xa0Taylor and Russell\\xa0Davies, who felt that rumours of print’s death had been greatly exaggerated. And with more reading being done digitally, the joy of holding something physical was more important than ever. As an experiment, they designed a newspaper called\\xa0Things Our Friends Have Written On The Internet. It delighted people so much that the seeds of Newspaper Club were born.With initial support from Channel\\xa04’s innovation fund 4iP, the team worked on making the process of designing and printing a newspaper easier. The first step, producing a good-looking newspaper without expensive, complicated design software, was solved by the invention of ARTHR – Newspaper Club’s free layout tool. The next step, finding someone to print it on real newsprint, and understanding what on earth they’re talking about was addressed by partnering with established newspaper printers and building an easy-to-use web service, staffed by a\\xa0team of friendly people.Since then, we've won a\\xa0Design of the Year\\xa0award for Graphics in 2010 and a\\xa0BIMA\\xa0for Technical Achievement, and we’ve grown to a team of 13, with offices in London, Birmingham and Glasgow.We’ve printed over 6 million newspapers for thousands of customers all over the world, including the BBC, Coca Cola, the Guardian, Penguin Books, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Sony Records.And yes, we're still excited about printing newspapers.\"\n",

Team members may start doing a certain job when they join the team and may end up 6 months later doing something completely different and this is perfectly normal.

      " \"Working at FBNAt FBN, we put farmers first. For every decision we make, we consider its impact on farmers big and small. Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone. Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings.\"\n",
